# AAPL-Stock-Analysis
Three different models for predicting stock prices: a Gradient Boosting Machine, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, and a Random Forest. These models are designed to analyse historical stock price data and make future predictions.

## Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
The Gradient Boosting Machine model uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions. It's known for its effectiveness in handling various types of data and its ability to capture complex patterns.

### Key Features
- Uses past data of closing prices to predict.
- Predicts future stock prices for a specified number of days.
- Includes a visualisation of both historical and predicted prices.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network
The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time series forecasting. It can capture long-term dependencies in data, making it ideal for stock price prediction.

### Key Features
- Analyses sequences of past data to predict future prices.
- Capable of making short-term predictions based on historical trends.
- Visualises the model's predictions alongside actual stock prices.

## Random Forest
The Random Forest model utilises a collection of decision trees to predict stock prices. It's effective in reducing overfitting and providing robust predictions.

### Key Features
- Employs multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Uses historical data to forecast future stock prices.
- Visualises predictions in comparison with actual historical data.
